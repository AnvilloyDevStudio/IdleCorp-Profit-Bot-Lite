During the progression of the project, this Lite version is made for the wide usability
other in only in its main server. Though this is still not a part of the HQ server,
it is still possible to use the bot functions in others places with this bot added.

However, with the termination of the bot maintanence, this bot is no longer usable.
Along the time, there may still some servers with IdleCorp being inactive and died
for the time being. It is inevitable, as every product eventually has its lifetime.
